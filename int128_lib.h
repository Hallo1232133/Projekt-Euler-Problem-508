/** this is a library where I wrote functions or redesigned them during a university project, because it was impossible to find any
useful material on 128 bit, There was no way to read them or print them
I hope that sometimes someone needs __int128 and now has proper functions
I do not guarantee for their always working especially because it's C
Be sure to star the project if you like it and put some issues if you find any.
